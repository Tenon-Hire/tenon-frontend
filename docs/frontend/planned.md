# Planned or Incomplete UI

The following items are not yet implemented in the frontend UI.

- Invite email verification as a distinct UI flow. Current UI surfaces 403 messaging from the backend.
- Day 4 recording capture and upload plus transcript pipeline. Current UI only shows a link extracted from the task prompt.
- Day 5 structured documentation form beyond freeform markdown. Current UI uses a text editor with markdown preview.
- Execution profile report view, comparison, and print/export. Current UI only shows report status in candidate tables.
- Enhanced duplicate run prevention and retry UX beyond the current run-tests locking and disabled button behavior.
